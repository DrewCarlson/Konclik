# Konclik: Kotlin/Native Command Line Interface Kit
Konclik is a library to simply develop a CLI applications with a Kotlin DSL.
It's based on Kotlin/Native, so it it could work on different platforms.

# Development
Due it's very (very, very) early development stage, the DSL and the
multi-platform features doesn't work yet. Please stay tuned.

## Build
The projects can be build with the integrated Gradle wrapper.
* Execute the `build` task to download all dependencies including Kotlin/Native
and build the project.
* Use the `run` task to execute the main function of the example project,
which includes (soon) examples of the DSL.
